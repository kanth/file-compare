Problem Statement
=================

Part 1: Find matching strings between the two provided files. It should be a case insensitive exact match of the names in the two files. (Duration 1 hour).

Part 2: After finishing part 1 of the assignment, introduce the notion of similarity between the names (as opposed to the exact string match). You are free to make reasonable (and justifiable) assumptions about what the similarity in this context should mean. (Duration: 2 hrs).
E.g.
